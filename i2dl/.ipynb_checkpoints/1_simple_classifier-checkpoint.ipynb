Then our data matrix has dimension $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times (D+1)}$. After you understood this situation, you can go back to the setting where our data matrix has dimension $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times (D+1)}$ and consists of $N$ samples each having $D+1$ features."

    "\n",

In each training step, the optimizer updates the weights of the model w.r.t. the output of the loss function, thereby linking the loss function and model parameters together. The goal is to obtain a model which is accurately predicting the class for a new sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "The weights are updated each step as follows:\n",
